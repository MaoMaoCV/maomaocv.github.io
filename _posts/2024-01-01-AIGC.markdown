In just over a year, text-to-image AI art generators have gone from closed betas to being [<u>literally</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YNku5FKWjw) [<u>everywhere</u>](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a40314356/dall-e-2-artificial-intelligence-cover/). What started with [<u>DALL·E 2</u>](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-dall-e-2/) has grown into a huge cultural movement. AI-powered art generators that have been around for years are having a surge in popularity, and new apps with interesting takes are launching every week. It feels like pretty much everyone is generating amazing, hilarious, and downright weird images, just by typing in a prompt. 

If you want to get in on the text-to-image action but aren't sure where to start, this list will help you out. It's a broader list than my picks for the [<u>best AI image generators</u>](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-image-generator/) in order to show off all the different angles that folks are taking with AI art generators.

Still, this isn't an exhaustive list of every app that can make AI art. Instead, it shows off the text-to-image AI art generators that worked when I tested them, are accessible through a web app, and seem not to be scams.

The category is changing so fast that by the time you read this, there might be even more great apps available. But for now, it's a pretty good overview of the biggest AI art apps available at the moment. 

## The top AI art generators

## How does AI art work?

The first time you [enter a prompt into an AI art generator](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-art-prompts) and it actually creates something that perfectly matches what you want, it feels like magic. But it turns out AI art generators don't work using magic. They use computers, machine learning, powerful graphics cards, and a whole lot of data to do their thing. 

Let's break it down. 

AI art generators take a text prompt and, as best they can, turn it into a matching image. Since your prompt can be anything, the first thing all these apps have to do is attempt to understand what you're asking. To do this, the AI algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands, millions, or even [<u>billions</u>](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) of image-text pairs. This allows them to learn the difference between dogs and cats, Vermeers and Picassos, and everything else. Different art generators have different levels of understanding of complex text, depending on the size of their training database, and some models are trained for specific purposes or only using licensed content, which affects the kinds of things they can generate.

The next step for the AI is to actually render the resulting image. There are two leading kinds of models:

-   **Diffusion models**, like Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 2, Midjourney, and CLIP-Guided Diffusion, which work by starting with a random field of noise, and then editing it in a series of steps to match its understanding of the prompt.
    
-   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, like VQGAN-CLIP, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, which have been around for a few years longer.
    

Both kinds of models can produce great, realistic results, though diffusion models are generally better at producing weird or wild images.

![Two renderings of the prompt from AI art generators based on different models](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/Htl4MAoa23JAbKtbdE5E2/04b5de45bb70435dfec727d2b8603890/AI_art_generator_models.png?w=1400)

<small>Prompt: A parrot detective wearing a deerstalker hat and smoking a pipe.</small>

While some apps are very open about which models they use, others obscure it. VQGAN-CLIP and Stable Diffusion, for example, are both open source, so there are a large number of apps that use them openly—and lots of others that don't say anything. There are also other apps that use their own data to custom-train various open source models to give better results.

This means that many AI art generators are essentially just different user interface skins for the same art-generating algorithms. From a business point of view, this is somewhat understandable. Still, it's annoying when you're trying to choose which app to use (or write about them). Where possible, I've listed what models each app uses. When it isn't declared, I've speculated, based on my experience with all these different generative AIs.

**How to use AI image generation at work** 

Interested in AI, but not quite sure how you'd use it at work? Here are a few of the ways people are turning to AI image generation in their roles:

-   Generating hero images for blog posts
    
-   Creating social media posts
    
-   Generating slide decks and storyboards
    
-   Creating personalized images for customers

Like Shutterstock, Getty Images has developed an AI art generator. [<u>Generative AI by Getty Images</u>](https://zapier.com/blog/getty-images-ai-generator) is trained on Getty's collection of stock images. This makes it good for generating weirdly specific stock photos, but not as competent or creative at other things. 

Best of all, though, Getty claims that its model is free from intellectual property issues, so you're indemnified against any legal claims resulting from using the images you make with its tool. If your company has a legal department, it might be that AI art generator you need. 

### [<u>Deep Dream Generator</u>](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/)

**AI art models:** Custom-trained models

## Other categories of AI art generators

This list is focused on text-to-image art generators, but there are entire other categories of AI art makers out there. Some examples:

-   [<u>Lensa's Magic Avatars</u>](https://land.prisma-ai.com/magic-avatars/) and [<u>MyHeritage's AI Time Machine</u>](https://www.myheritage.com/ai-time-machine) both take a series of selfies and return AI-generated portraits. 
    
-   Many text-generating apps, like [<u>Writesonic</u>](https://writesonic.com/) and [<u>Rytr</u>](https://rytr.me/), also include AI art generators, so you can create images to go along with your copy. 
    
-   I was only looking at web apps in this list, but there are mobile-only art generators like [<u>ArtOut</u>](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artout-ai-image-generator/id6450302983), if you just want something on your smartphone.
    
-   And then there are others, like [<u>Palette</u>](https://palette.fm/), that can colorize photos. 
    

And these are just the AI art generators that are available _now_. Other companies are certainly testing their own art generators, and you could always train your own using one of the apps I mentioned that allows for that.

## Make the most of your AI art

## Which AI art generator should you use?

With so many AI art generators to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. So let me break it down:

-   Midjourney is my favorite, though the free trial is temporarily paused, and using it through Discord is weird. 
    
-   DALL·E 2 is great, but it's cheaper to access it through Bing Image Creator. 
    
-   Stable Diffusion is used in lots of different apps. The simplest way to access it is through its own app, DreamStudio.
    
-   Firefly's text effects are awesome, as is its integration with other Adobe tools.
    
-   NightCafe and OpenArt are the best apps if you want to play around with different models, including some of the older GAN models. 
    
-   Deep Dream Generator is a great way to see how far art generators have come. 
    
-   Artbreeder is perhaps the weirdest art generator among a very weird series of art generators—and totally worth a look. 
    

Otherwise, just scroll through the list and try whichever ones strike your fancy. You can't go too far wrong.
